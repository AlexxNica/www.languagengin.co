                languag<span class="logo-e">e</span>ngine is a highly customizable drop-in solution
                for enabling natural, conversational voice control in any app.

                <div class="question">
                    <h2>What can I do with LE?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Because languag<span class="logo-e">e</span>ngine is a generic tool for voice control,
                        you can customize the vocabulary that it uses to understand your
                        users. This means you can tailor their experience to be
                        completely natural.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        languag<span class="logo-e">e</span>ngine's conversational design makes it easy for you to
                        create apps that you talk <em>with</em> rather than <em>at</em>.
                        This lets users interact in more natural, complex ways that
                        feel more like talking to a person than to a machine.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="question">
                    <h2>How does LE work?</h2>
                    <p>
                        languag<span class="logo-e">e</span>ngine uses cutting edge syntactic and semantic theory
                        to interpret user input. Unlike other systems, LE actually tries
                        to understand what a user is saying, rather than just looking
                        for keywords.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After interpreting what the user has said, languag<span class="logo-e">e</span>ngine issues
                        commands to your app. If the input was a question, such as
                        <em>did anyone reply to my tweet?</em>, LE will query your app
                        for the appropriate information to respond. If the input was a command,
                        such as <em>respond to that</em>, LE will determine what actions
                        it needs to take to execute that command.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        languag<span class="logo-e">e</span>ngine can even handle complex commands such as
                        <em>save any new replies for later then read my timeline</em>
                        without any extra programming. This is because LE comes with a built-in
                        vocabulary for core function words like <em>the</em>, <em>any</em>,
                        and <em>then</em>.
                    </p>

                <div class="question">
                    <h2>How can I get LE?</h2>

                        languag<span class="logo-e">e</span>ngine isn't available to developers yet, but we're aiming for
                        a late 2014 release of the developer beta. If you've signed up to get emails
                        from us, we'll let you know as soon as there's news.
